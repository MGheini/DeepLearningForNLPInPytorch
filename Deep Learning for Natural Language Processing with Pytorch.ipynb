    "Many of the concepts (such as the computation graph abstraction and autograd) are not unique to Pytorch and are relevant to any deep learning tool kit out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am writing this tutorial to focus specifically on NLP for people who have never written code in any deep learning framework (e.g, TensorFlow, Theano, Keras, Dynet).  It assumes working knowledge of core NLP problems: part-of-speech tagging, language modeling, etc.  It also assumes familiarity with neural networks at the level of an intro AI class (such as one from the Russel and Norvig book).  Usually, these courses cover the basic backpropagation algorithm on feed-forward neural networks, and make the point that they are chains of compositions of linearities and non-linearities.  This tutorial aims to get you started writing deep learning code, given you have this prerequisite knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note this is about *models*, not data.  For all of the models, I just create a few test examples with small dimensionality so you can see how the weights change as it trains.  If you have some real data you want to try, you should be able to rip out any of the models from this notebook and use them on it."

    "### Dyanmic versus Static Deep Learning Toolkits\n",
    "\n",
    "Pytorch is a *dynamic* neural network kit.  Another example of a dynamic kit is [Dynet](https://github.com/clab/dynet) (I mention this because working with Pytorch and Dynet is similar.  If you see an example in Dynet, it will probably help you implement it in Pytorch).  The opposite is the *static* tool kit, which includes Theano, Keras, TensorFlow, etc.\n",
    "The core difference is the following:\n",
    "* In a static toolkit, you define a computation graph once, compile it, and then stream instances to it.\n",
    "* In a dynamic toolkit, you define a computation graph *for each instance*.  It is never compiled and is executed on-the-fly\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a lot of experience, it is difficult to appreciate the difference.\n",
    "One example is to suppose we want to build a deep constituent parser.\n",
    "Suppose our model involves roughly the following steps:\n",
    "* We build the tree bottom up\n",
    "* Tag the root nodes (the words of the sentence)\n",
    "* From there, use a neural network and the embeddings of the words\n",
    "to find combinations that form constituents.  Whenever you form a new constituent,\n",
    "use some sort of technique to get an embedding of the constituent.\n",
    "<font color=red>In this case, our network architecture will depend completely on the input sentence.</font>\n",
    "In the sentence \"The green cat scratched the wall\", at some point in the model, we will want to combine\n",
    "the span $(i,j,r) = (1, 3, \\text{NP})$ (that is, an NP constituent spans word 1 to word 3, in this case \"The green cat\").\n",
    "\n",
    "However, another sentence might be \"Somewhere, the big fat cat scratched the wall\".  In this sentence, we will want to form the constituent $(2, 4, NP)$ at some point.\n",
    "The constituents we will want to form will depend on the instance.  If we just compile the computation graph once, as in a static toolkit, it will be exceptionally difficult or impossible to program this logic.  In a dynamic toolkit though, there isn't just 1 pre-defined computation graph.  There can be a new computation graph for each instance, so this problem goes away.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic toolkits also have the advantage of being easier to debug and the code more closely resembling the host language (by that I mean that Pytorch and Dynet look more like actual Python code than Keras or Theano).\n",
    "\n",
    "I mention this distinction here, because the exercise in this section is to implement a model which closely resembles structure perceptron, and I believe this model would be difficult to implement in a static toolkit.  I think that the advantage of dynamic toolkits for linguistic structure prediction cannot be overstated."

    "### Bi-LSTM Conditional Random Field Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "For this section, we will see a full, complicated example of a Bi-LSTM Conditional Random Field for named-entity recognition.  The LSTM tagger above is typically sufficient for part-of-speech tagging, but a sequence model like the CRF is really essential for strong performance on NER.  Familiarity with CRF's is assumed.  Although this name sounds scary, all the model is is a CRF but where an LSTM provides the features.  This is an advanced model though, far more complicated than any earlier model in this tutorial.  If you want to skip it, that is fine.  To see if you're ready, see if you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write the recurrence for the viterbi variable at step i for tag k.\n",
    "* Modify the above recurrence to compute the forward variables instead.\n",
    "* Modify again the above recurrence to compute the forward variables in log-space (hint: log-sum-exp)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can do those three things, you should be able to understand the code below.\n",
    "Recall that the CRF computes a conditional probability.  Let $y$ be a tag sequence and $x$ an input sequence of words.  Then we compute\n",
    "$$ P(y|x) = \\frac{\\exp{(\\text{Score}(x, y)})}{\\sum_{y'} \\exp{(\\text{Score}(x, y')})} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the score is determined by defining some log potentials $\\log \\psi_i(x,y)$ such that\n",
    "$$ \\text{Score}(x,y) = \\sum_i \\log \\psi_i(x,y) $$\n",
    "To make the partition function tractable, the potentials must look only at local features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Bi-LSTM CRF, we define two kinds of potentials: emission and transition.  The emission potential for the word at index $i$ comes from the hidden state of the Bi-LSTM at timestep $i$.  The transition scores are stored in a $|T|x|T|$ matrix $\\textbf{P}$, where $T$ is the tag set.  In my implementation, $\\textbf{P}_{j,k}$ is the score of transitioning to tag $j$ from tag $k$.  So:\n",

    "$$ \\text{Score}(x,y) = \\sum_i \\log \\psi_\\text{EMIT}(y_i \\rightarrow x_i) + \\log \\psi_\\text{TRANS}(y_{i-1} \\rightarrow y_i) $$\n",
    "$$ = \\sum_i h_i[y_i] + \\textbf{P}_{y_i, y_{i-1}} $$\n",
    "where in this second expression, we think of the tags as being assigned unique non-negative indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the above discussion was too brief, you can check out [this](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/%7Emcollins/crf.pdf) write up from Michael Collins on CRFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Forward Algorithm in Log-Space and the Log-Sum-Exp Trick\n",
    "\n",
    "As hinted at above, computing the forward variables requires using a log-sum-exp.  I want to explain why, since it was a little confusing to me at first, and many resources just present the forward algorithm in potential space.  The recurrence for the forward variable at the $i$'th word for the tag $j$, $\\alpha_i(j)$, is\n",
    "$$ \\alpha_i(j) = \\sum_{j' \\in T} \\psi_\\text{EMIT}(j \\rightarrow i) \\times \\psi_\\text{TRANS}(j' \\rightarrow j) \\times \\alpha_{i-1}(j') $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is numerically unstable, and underflow is likely.  It is also inconvenient to work with proper non-negative potentials in our model.  We instead want to compute $\\log \\alpha_i(j)$.  What we need to do is to multiply the potentials, which corresponds to adding log potentials.  Then, we have to sum over tags, but what is the corresponding operation to summing over tags in log space?  It is not clear.  Instead, we need to transform out of log-space, take the product of potentials, do the sum over tags, and then transform back to log space.  This is broken down in the revised recurrence below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\log \\alpha_i(j) = \\log \\overbrace{\\sum_{j' \\in T} \\exp{(\\log \\psi_\\text{EMIT}(j \\rightarrow i) + \\log \\psi_\\text{TRANS}(j' \\rightarrow j) + \\log \\alpha_{i-1}(j'))}}^\\text{transform out of log-space and compute forward variable} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you carry out elementary exponential / logarithm identities in the stuff under the overbrace above, you will see that it computes the same thing as the first recurrence, then just takes the logarithm.  Log-sum-exp appears a fair bit in machine learning, and there is a [well-known trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LogSumExp) to computing it in a numerically stable way.  I use this trick in my log_sum_exp function below (I don't think Pytorch provides this function in its library).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below implements the forward algorithm in log space to compute the partition function, and the viterbi algorithm to decode.  Backpropagation will compute the gradients automatically for us.  We don't have to do anything by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation is not optimized.  If you understand what is going on, you'll probably quickly see that iterating over the next tag in the forward algorithm could probably be done in one big operation.  I wanted to code to be more readable.  If you want to make the relevant change, you could probably use this tagger for real tasks."

Since we have it anyway, try training the tagger where the loss function is the difference between the Viterbi path score and the score of the gold-standard path.  It should be clear that this function is non-negative and 0 when the predicted tag sequence is the correct tag sequence.  This is essentially *structured perceptron*.\n",

Although I haven't tried implementing this in a static toolkit, I imagine that it is possible but much less straightforward.\n",
